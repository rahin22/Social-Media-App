# Social-Media-App
A social media app desgined using Flask & SQLite, created as a more complex and robust application harnessing relational databases

To run the app:

1. First create a folder in which you will store the repository files
   -
   - You can name this whatever you want just make sure you don't store the application files within a subfolder inside the created folder. This excludes any folders
   within the actual application files such as "static".
   - Simply just put all downloaded folders and files from this repo within this created folder
2. Inside this folder create a python virtual enivronment
   -
   - To do this on Visual Studio Code, open the folder you have created to store the application files inside VSCode
   - Open the Command Palette with Ctrl+Shift+P, Then select Python: Create Environment. Select venv
   - Open the Command Palette again (Ctrl+Shift+P), Go to Terminal: Select Default Profile and select Command Prompt
   - Open the Command Palette one more time (Ctrl+Shift+P), Select Terminal: Create New Terminal
   - In the new terminal, type and run: ```python -m pip install flask```
   - After that has done downloading, go on to the terminal and run ```pip install -r requirements.txt ``` to download all necessary packages
3. Now run the app.py file
   -
   - You should now see the terminal start and give you the local server the application is running at
   - This is usually 127.0.0.1:5000 or localhost:5000
4. Finally go on your browser and enter the server address that the application is running at
   -
   - Type in 127.0.0.1:5000 or localhost:5000 into your search bar either will work
   - And now your done the application should be running
